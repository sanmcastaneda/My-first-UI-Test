1. Save the Metropolis Test folder on your machine in any directory of your choice.
2. Make sure that Google Chrome drivers for both Windows and Mac are saved in the Root directory of the Metropolis Test Project. I added them to the folder, but just in case, they can also be found in https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=76.0.3809.68/
2. Launch Eclipse.
3. In File, select "Open File".
4. Look for the Metropolist Test folder that you previously saved and select src > com > demo > testcases > ChromeScripts.java
5. While on the ChromeScripts.java select "Run" to run the script.

Thanks!
